## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture (SOA).
> Service-oriented architecture (SOA) is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. Each service provides a business capability, and services can also communicate with each other across platforms and languages.
2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
> Loose Coupling -> Services are like independent, stand-alone components that can operate independently. If one part changes, the others remain unaffected.
> Interoperability -> Allows easy communication between components, even if they are built using different languages or technologies.
> Discoverability -> It functions similarly to a menu, allowing you to view what's available and select what you need.
> Reusability -> Performs a specific function and can be used in multiple contexts. It is comparable to owning a multipurpose instrument.
> Flexibility -> Allowing you to add or change services without causing major delays. This is similar to moving furniture around a room without rearranging the entire property.
3. Define Microservices.
> Microservices are an architectural and organizational approach to software development where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. These services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
> Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.
4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
> Scalability -> We can make efficient use of resources by allowing separate parts of the system to scale up or down on their own.
> Agility and Faster Development -> Different parts of a system can be updated and released individually and quickly. It speeds everything up, like working on many small projects at once.
> Improved Maintainability -> improve the understanding and maintenance of specific parts of the system without affecting other parts. Allows you to make changes to one without affecting the others.
> Independent Deployability -> A part of the system can be updated or changed without affecting the entire operation.
> Technology Diversity -> Allow us to use different technologies for different parts of the system. It makes everything more versatile, like how different tools are used for different jobs.
5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
> Building Blocks -> Both service-oriented architecture and microservices divide software into simpler, easier-to manage independent components.
> Flexible Connections -> For flexibility, they both promote weak connections between these parts of the building.
> Business Alignment -> Their respective goals are to match these blocks to specific business operations or capacities.
6. Define Web Services.
> A web service is either: a service offered by an electronic device to another electronic device, communicating with each other via the Internet, or a server running on a computer device, listening for requests at a particular port over a network, serving web documents.
7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
> Easy to Find -> Web services are easy to find and use by many applications because they have a mechanism to advertise themselves to other programs. It works like a directory that shows every tool provided.
> Easy Fixes -> You can update or fix a tool without affecting ongoing project work. This is similar to repairing a machine part without having to completely shut down production.
> Work Anywhere -> The type of machine or operating system you are using is related to web services. They serve as a kind of universal translators, allowing communication between people to be possible.
> Handle a Lot of Work -> Applications can divide their work by using web services. This is similar to many workers working online to complete a large task.
> Save Money on Connections -> Web services offer an affordable alternative to creating a completely new interface for different applications to communicate with each other. This is similar to communicating using a common language or protocol.
8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
> Interoperability -> Web services provide cross-system communication and coordination between different computer systems, such as language groups.
> Loose Coupling -> You may link these blocks using web services, allowing you to adjust one without affecting the others.
> Reusability -> Web services are like tools that you can use for different purposes. Once someone creates a valuable instrument, everyone can take it and use it for their own projects.
> Scalability -> Web services allow the distribution of work across several computers, much like a large workforce working together to complete a large task.
> Easy Maintenance -> It is possible to fix a web service tool without having to stop the project entirely. It's like fixing a machine without pausing production altogether.
9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
> Service Provider -> to produce and distribute a useful service, such as creating a tool and giving access to others. 
> Service Consumer -> use an item or service that was developed by another person to do a task.
> Service Registry -> maintains an inventory of all the web services and tools that are accessible so that others may locate them with easily.
> Service Broker -> simplifies communication between services by acting as a helper.
10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.
> SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) -> SOAP is used by many computers to communicate with one another. It helps in their comprehension of how to communicate organized information.
> WSDL (Web Services Description Language) -> WSDL is similar to an instruction manual for a particular web service. It explains the capabilities of the service and how to make requests of it.
> UDDI (Universal Description, Discovery, and Integration) -> is comparable to a large phone book or directory. It helps locating available services and their contact information.
> XML (eXtensible Markup Language) -> XML is comparable to a universal data translator. By arranging data equally, it promotes information sharing and understanding across many systems.
> HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure) -> HTTP/HTTPS is comparable to the course of action taken by data as it moves between computers. It guarantees the flow of information across the internet.
